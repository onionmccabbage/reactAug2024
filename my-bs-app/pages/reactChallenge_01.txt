you have 20 minutes (then show-and-tell)

Inside the Button component
- declare a number-input field:
    <input type={'number'} min={'1'} max={'5'} />
-declare a stateful data-model for 'whichRobot'
    const [whichRobot, setWhichRobot]=useState(1)
Set the value of the number-input field to whichRobot
Also add a change handler that calls a function
Inside that function, increment the value of whichRobot
Then use the whichRobot data-model in the image src url
You will know it works if you see different robots for different numbers in this input field

Optional If Time
================
Raise the whichRobot state and change-handler up to the Panel component
Pass them in as props to the Button component
You will know it works if you can show the value of whichRobot in the Panel component
