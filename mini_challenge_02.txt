you have 25 minutes
Continue with the using_js page
Add an <input type='number' /> element
Give that element an id and set min=1 max=5
( nb you will need to add a listener for 'change' to the field )
Write code so that when the number changes, the character is retrieved from that set
    const imageURL = `https://robohash.org/${n}?set=set${m}` // ${m} comes from the number field

Optional (if time)
Let the user choose which bgset (1 or 2) to use
    https://robohash.org/${n}?set=set${n}&bgset=bg1 // or bg2
