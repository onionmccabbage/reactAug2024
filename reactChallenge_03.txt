You have 35 minutes

The 'TickerComponent' will let the user enter a Company name
The Company Name will then be passed to an API
The returned data will be iterated to show any matching tickers

Details:
Provide a text input field for (case sensitive) Company name
Bind the value to a stateful data-model
Handle changes to the text field (so it is a controlled field)
(You might choose to provide a button to be clicked)

Write 'useEffect' and fetch data from
    `https://ticker-2e1ica8b9.now.sh/keyword/${companyName}%20`
    ('companyName' comes from your text field)
Make sure 'useEffect' responds to changes in 'companyName'
You will need to 'setState' for the returned data (default is [])

Use Array.map() to iterate over the returned data
Remember to set a key and render 'ticker.name' and 'ticker.symbol'

You will know it is working if 'CitiGroup' returns about 9 results
Other companies to try (case sensitive): 
- NextEra Energy, First Solar, Cisco, Microsoft, Facebook, Bloom Energy Corporation

Optional (if time)
------------------
Make a 'TickerDetailComponent' that can render a single result. 
Use this to render your iterated returned data

Think about how you could add a 'buy' button for each ticker on screen
Clicking any button should increments a quantity value for that ticker
Each ticker would default to quantity 0
(this value is local to the app, nothing to do with any API)
