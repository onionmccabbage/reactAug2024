Making a Production build
=========================
- In your JSX you may need to change {country.name.common} to {country['name']['common']}
  (use square-bracket notation instead of dot notation within JSX)

- Open next.config.mjs and edit as below:
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
    // these next lines change how 'npm run build' works: 
    output: 'export',  // export to static deployable files
    images: {
        unoptimized: true, // this lets us use normal <img> tags
    },
    // default
    reactStrictMode: true,
    };
    export default nextConfig;

Then execute: npm run build
The deployable site will end up in a folder called 'out' (this is your entire website)
NB delete the 'out' folder (and the '.next' folder if it exists) before running npm run build a second time
