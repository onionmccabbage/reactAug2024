Steps to make a new React Project:
(first ensure you have NodeJS installed at a recent version)
Pick a location, open a  terminal and enter:
    npx create-next-app@latest --template bootstrap
Answer the questions as you see fit
Change directory into your newly-created project folder
    cd my-app (or whatever you called it)
Invoke the development server
    npm run dev
Browse to https://localhost:3000
from here on, it's a matter of editing the files in your new project......

q - how do we know it's index.js or app.js ....????
q - how may we conditionally render components
q - do we have to stick to this immutability doobrie?
q - are there consequences
 try: npm install --global @create-next-app/core
 then npm create-next-app@latest --template bootstrap
 npx will download and execute without installing
 q - whats with the underscores???

- NodeJS - lets us run JS on the server (or anywhere) It is the JS engine from chrome
  - NB we need Node 20 or better!!
- async JS, promises ....
q - keeping pace (and secure) with external libraries
